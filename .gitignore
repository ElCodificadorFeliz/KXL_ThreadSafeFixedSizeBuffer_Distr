###
### exclude everything ("*") and re)include folders ("!*/") afterwards and this way prompt GIt to recursively (re)include (all wanted) files
### the statement ("!*/") to (re)include all directory has not to be the first - it can also be everywhere, especially the last
###
*
!*/



###
### (re)include wanted stuff (this is done recursively as result of "!*\")
###=========================
###

# (re)include explizit stuff (recursively as result of "!*\")
!.gitignore

!readme.md
!ReadMe.txt
!*readme*.txt

!*.java





###
### exclude for safety's sake
###==========================
###
#
# NOT needed  if everything was excluded before
#
#
# exclude OS specific stuff:
#---------------------------
# exclude annoying stuff: DOSe
"System Volume Information"
**/Thumbs.db
**/*.swp
# exclude annoying stuff: Mac OS X
**/.DS_Store
#
# exclude BlueJ/project specific stuff:
#--------------------------------------
**/*.class
**/*.ctxt
**/doc
**/package.bluej
#
#
# exclude the very synchronize script (respectively "check-in" script), since problems might occur, if synchronize script checks itself in (synchronize was named check-in before)
synchronizeWithOriginMasterBranch.bash
check-in





#~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
#
# THE END  -  END OF SCRIPT
#==========================
#
#
# Unfortunately,
#->     *                       # wont work part1 :'-(
#->     !**/wantedFile          # wont work part2 :'-(
# is not working - you can NOT (re)include files in directories this way
#
# the workaround (see above) is still under test
#
#
#
#VVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVV
#
# => only the listed exceptions in the current directory are checked in
#
# "!.gitignore"
#     including ".gitignore" results in same (git-)behavior everywhere - is this wanted?
#
# "*" 
#     excludes everything - unfortunately it is NOT supported to (re)include a (sub-)directory afterwards (2014/10/15)
#
#     but, you can type directly in GIT bash e.g.:
#     "git add --force CEPtemplate/Project/*.h"
#     "git add --force CEPtemplate/Project/*.c"
